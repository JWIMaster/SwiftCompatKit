# SwiftCompatKit
## A compatibility layer for iOS 6's Swift 2.2. 
This project aims to backport most of Swift 3's naming/API changes, as well as some other Swift 4 and 5 goodies. This should aid in the ease of development when targeting a legacy device.
## Instructions for use
Download the repository, and copy the lowest level SwiftCompatKit folder to your project. This is only for use in Xcode 7.3.1. Swift 2.3 requires modifications to a few API's, as the iOS 10 SDK added methods seperately from Swift that conflict.
